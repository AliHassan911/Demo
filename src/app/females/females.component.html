She always like to play and is so obedient that she loves to play with kids as well.  <br> The purpose of keeping her at the yard is to breed her. As we know her previous record of produing , She has produced one of the best dog Kaleemi Kennels ever owned. He was a deep gamedog. She also has produced a litter in USA at Diesel Fuel Kennels, They had bred her to her half brother named Diesel Fuel Kennel's Skibo, Skibo produces fire. that breeding had 4 puppies, which had a bitch named Sammy. I personally has spoken to Sammy's owner anf he is very satisfied with her result. He also has shown alot of interset to have any progeny of her again. <br> Breeding Crybaby to Methodman has produced Tatanka, Rewardo, Hench and many other dogs for us, they are showing their abilities now and we are very satisfied from them.  </p>

        <p>Badger was born and bred in Baaqee Muhammad's Kennel named Buck Bred Kennel in Virginia , USA. Before getting her, Me and Sky Loft (my Big Brother) were searching for tight jeep dogs but then we realized that we also has a 50% Jeep bred female Crybaby , so we changed our plan started searching for a nicely bred RBJBT bred female. we found alot of dogs but they were not up to the mark and were not fullfilling our requirement. At few months of search Sky Loft found Badger and he directly sent me her pedigree and picture. I saw very Calm puppy in the picture but it clicked me, after huge discussion with the breeder me and Sky Loft decided that we are gonna buy her. Then we bought her and sent her to Massacheusets and then Pakistan from there. She is now living at our yard in here. <br> Badger is heavily bred on Redboy-Jocko-Bolio-Tombstone. She is daughter to Buck Bred Kennel's Machobred out of Buck Bred Kennel's Miss Deva. Machobred was out of Machobear II ROM and Titan Kennel's Lady Caribou. It was a very good breeding , which was Gr Ch Machobuck on top and Hollingsworth's Bull on bottom. That is a typical breeding of Redboy Jocko Bolio Tombstone. On the hand , if we look out Miss Deva's Pedigree. She is daughter to Rbjbt Kennel's Jack Sparrow, Who was son to Ch Joe D's Pirate out of Dvn's Miss Blitz. Miss Blitz was heavily bred Hollingsworth Bull bitch. Coming back to Alamo City Kennel's Crazy Blaze, She was bred Patrick's bloodline while on bottom, She was heavily bred Bommerang Bitch. </p>

        <p>Miss Destro was bred by Jose R. Serrano Rivera in Mexico. She was two months old when we bought her and sent her to USA to our family. She was raised by Fazal Haq (owner's nephew) and was almost two years old when he sent her to Pakistan. <br> Miss Destro aka Merigold is one of the finest specimen of our yard, She is daughter to Pr Fugutive's Varon the Joker out of Backroad's Miss joker.It was basically a Sire-daughter bredding. Varon the Joker is direct son to Gr Ch Fugutive's Destroyer. while Destroyer was son to Gr Ch YellowBuck out of Twin Bulldog's Uzy. STP's Peggy Sue is Dam to Varon the Joker , Peggy was direct daughter to Gr Ch haunch and Grand Daughter to Gr Ch Mayday. <br> If you see pedigree of Miss Destro, she is full of Gr Champions, You can almost find 10 Grand Champions in her 4th generation pedigree. All you can see alot of Mayday and Buck blood in her. <br> Miss Destro has really hard mouth , i'll give 9/10 to her mouth. She is strong like a Bull and athletic like a trained athlete. She can add alot of mouth to our bloodline and can also increase the size of our dogs with alot of agility. <br>Our plans are really very high for, hope she will fullfill all our requirements and can make our dogs more stronger. </p>
