Unfortunantely at his time we didn't found a Game dog for him so we decided to match him against locally bred dogs where he never lost a single match in his career.

       <p>Tucker was the first dog Kaleemi Kennels Started with. He was bred by Mr Pete Colby a son of Louis Colby and Grandson of the Legendary Dogman John Pitchard Colby. Tucker was Sired by Silva's Iron Ball Buster who was Out of Colby's Red and RainHard's Rainbow. Red was a pure Colby dog who was Sired by Colby's Buster out of Hill's Dusky while Rainbow was heavily bred Carver bitch. Tucker's dam was Colby's Kirby , she was one of the best brood bitch of colby's yard of her time. Kirby was Sired by Colby's Dolan out of Colby's Sue. <br>
        Tucker was dual registered dog, he was registered by ADBA as well as UKC, his ADBA and UKC Registration Numbers were ADBA, 84500D-44L/ UKC, P183-83 . <br>
        We used him as our main stud dog from 1993 to 1997. we bred him to our Pure colby bitches, one was Kaleemi Kennel's Hayley and other was Kaleemi Kennel's Dee Dee, He bred very amazing with them and we got some great dogs of our history from them. On the other hand we bred him to our other Senior brood bitch Kaleemi Kennels's Cher , who gave an extra ordinary result with tucker and from whom we got some really great dogs.
        Tucker died in the end of 1999 due to hepatitis.</p>

       <p>Jay was imported to Pakistan in 1994 by Kaleemi Kennels Straight away from Tom Garner's Yard. Jay was sired by the top producer of all times The Great Garner's Frisco , asically he was inbred son to Frisco who when bred to his daughter Garner's China Girl 2. China Girl 2's dam was Chinaman's daughter China Girl 1. Jay had 75% blood of Frisco and and 69% of Chinaman. Chinaman was Sired by Wood's trouble out of Abernathy's Molly. He was bred by Randell Abernathy and was Owned by Tom Garner. He was 50/50 Eli-Carver. <br>
        So going back to Kaleemi Kennel's Jay, was actually a heavy Eli-Carver dog, He was a late starter dog, but when he started at the age of 5 years, he was one hell of a dog, he was straight finisher, he would went on a dogs throat and would kill him from there. As he was heavily bred on Chinaman and Chinaman was Champion dog and was a 4x Killer too, Jay carried his genetics and would go accordingly on the traits he was carrying. He was a fast finisher, Athletic, hard mouth and Game dog. He lived a great life at our yard , he will be missed always.</p>

       <p>Kaleemi Kennel's (PR'Colby's) Bodger was bred by Louis B. Colby , Sired by Colby's Bud 2 out of Colby's Lacey, he was whelped on 03/02/1992 and was imported to Pakistan in 1994. <br>
        Let us discuss his Pedigree, His sire Colby's Bud 2 who was a perfect replice of Colby's Bloodline. Bud 2 was sired by Colby's Bud out of Colby's peggy. while Colby's Lacey was Sired by Colby's Dolan (A very great Stud dog Lou Colby) out of Colby's Sue , who was sired by Colby's Buster out of Colby's Nell. Bodger was dual registered from ADBA and UKC. <br>
        Bodger when tested with some other Gamedogs in the yard, he did really well, he showed some great mouth and deep Game. He got his schooling from Kaleemi Kennel's Tucker and Kaleemi Kennel's leprechaun. After completing his education he went for a few matches in the hometown with some locally bred dogs due to unavailibility of Gamedogs, He won all of his matches with them , which literally means nothing for a gamedog because a Game dog shows his abilities only with Gamedogs, but we were satisfied from him because we already had saw him infront of our eyes at our yard.
        Bodger was died in the year 2000.</p>

       <p>Kaleemi Kennel's Leprechaun was bred by Pete Colby of Colby Kennels in MA, USA. He was purchased and brought by us in the year 1994 to Pakistan. He was a Brindle/White dog and was dual registered by ADBA and UKC. <br>
        Leprechaun was sired by Colby's Grit out of Colby's Kirby. Grit was sired by Colby's Red out of Colby's UNO while Kirby was Sired by Colby's Dolan out of Colby's Sue. Leprechaun was 25% Colby's Buster who was a great producing stud dog of Louis Colby. There is a female dog in 3rd generation of Leprechaun, whose name was Colby's Lotus , She was main brood bitch of Lou Colby. while in the same generation an another dog we see , who was a very famous dog of Lou Colby is Colby's Galtie 2. <br>
        If we see his Pit Career Leprechaun was never campaigned, because he was man biter who never accepted his new owner. One day my father brought him out of his cage in yard to give him a short role against Kaleemi Kennels Jay, they did a good satisfying Role, but when my father did try to stop their role, Leprechaun directly attacked on my father , unfortunatly he didn't reached to my father's throat because he catched him immediatly and threw him in his cage, soon after few days he did a second attack on my father, we never had an another option except make him sleep forever, it was his last day of Life. He was a good dog who will be remembered always.</p>
