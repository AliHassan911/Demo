        <p>Biggie was born on 12-27-2013 at the yard of the legendary dogman Mr Victor Aycart in Equador. He was combinely bred by Victor Aycart and John Brown. His Sire was a well known dog named Cox the team Bigday and his Dam was bred and by Southern Kennels themselves, her name was Southern Kennel's Betzy. Biggie is the most heavily bred Mayday dog in Pakistan, Mayday's percentage in Biggie is 31% just in 4 generations. He has 7 Gr Champions in just 4 generation pedigree. <br>Biggie was bought by Kaleemi Kennels in early 2014 and sent him to USA to the owner's Nephew Fazal Haq. Biggie was raised by Fazal Haq till the age of 2 years , then he sent him to Pakistan. <br> Biggie was showing alot of good response when he came to pakistan. But when we decided to roll him for the first time , we noticed that he is having breathing issue from the start, we rolled him for 10 minutes and then directly went to vet , when the vet analyzed him, he said that Biggie's lungs are damaged from the early age and yo can't fight him anymore. So we decided to give up on him , but he was still showing alot of good response when see other dogs, he killed 2 dogs accidently at the yard in few minutes. <br> Biggie is now standing at the yard for just breeding purpose.  </p>

    <p>Tatanka the Bull was born at Kaleemi Kennels. He is the first ever son of Kaleemi Kennel's Methodman 1xGl. Tatanka is the result of a Son to Dam breeding, He is inbred son of Kaleemi Kennels Crybaby. Crybaby is one of the finest producers of Kaleemi Kennels. As we have seen her producing ability through her son Methodman himself, he was a real gamedog. I've not seen such a great Gamedog like him ever in my life. He was alot strong, athletic and Game dog. <br> By watching Tatanka's pedigree, you can see alot of Tight bred dogs, whose genetics are alot strong to produce some great producers further. Tatanka has 56.75% blood of Pit Fire Kennel's Ralo POR. Ralo was a direct son of Pit Island Kennel's Boomer , who was tight bred Redboy dog.  <br> This family of dogs are made to produce some real great gamedogs. As by my personal experience, you can get goods by breeding them in out crosses. They produce fire in out cross, while they produce breeders in line breeding or inbreeding. <br> Tatanka also have 75% blood of Crybaby , which is very useful to us. Our plans for tatanka is to produce good pit dogs through him by breeding him to our one of the best RBJBT female named Kaleemi Kennel's Badger and our other nicely bred female dogs.</p>
